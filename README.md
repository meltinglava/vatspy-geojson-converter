# vatspy-geojson-converter

This tool converts fir.geojson and FIRBoundaries.dat files for vatspy.

## Test
for now copy `FIRBoundaries.dat` into this project locally. 
Run `cargo run --relase`. 
It will generate all the files that are generated back and forward 
locally so they can be inspeced.

## installing rust

### windows
install rustup either throught [rustup.rs](https://win.rustup.rs/)
or throguht [scoop](scoop.sh) with `scoop install rustup` followed by `rustup update`

## TODO!

Still some small features to be fixed. Check issues.
